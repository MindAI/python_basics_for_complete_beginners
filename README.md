# python_basics_for_complete_beginners

This iPython/ Jupyter notebook file was used for a Python workshop session that I gave in Purdue University in 2016. That session was designed specifically for complete beginners, i.e. learners that do not even have any coding background. The file was written in Python 2. It is heavily commented and self-explanatory.
